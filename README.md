## A Simple Sencha Touch 2 Example

It's hard to create a "simple" Sencha Touch 2 example that does 
anything interesting, but I'm giving it a try here. I'll add
more documentation over time, but for the time being, I hope the
screenshots help explain what this app does.

(Ignore the "URLs" tab. I just wanted a third tab, and put that 
text in there, because I recently wrote my own URL-shortener app.)

### Images

Here are a few images that show what the running app looks like.

First, the main screen:

Next, the "List Notes" screen:

Finally, the "Add Note" screen:
